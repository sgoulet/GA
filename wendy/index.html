    <p>The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami, Florida.  The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur).  They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store.  In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5]  The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.[6][7]</p>
